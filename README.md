MeetFrames is an elegantly simple application designed for Farcaster users, enabling them to effortlessly auction their time to followers through a four-step event frame creation process. At its core, MeetFrames addresses a common hesitation among experts and influencers: the uncertainty and reluctance to monetize personal time, despite having a follower base eager for direct interaction.

The Problem:
Many individuals, despite being experts in their fields with a considerable following, hesitate to capitalize on their time due to uncertainty about their market value and the fear of overpricing or undervaluing themselves. This uncertainty often leads to missed opportunities for meaningful interactions and personal brand growth.

My Solution:
MeetFrames offers a dynamic solution by providing a platform where users can gauge their true market value through a real-time auction. By creating an event frame, users can showcase event details and open the floor for followers to bid on their time. This process not only democratizes access to influential figures but also allows these figures to understand their worth as perceived by their audience.

How It Works:
1. Create an Event Frame: Users can set up an auction in just a few clicks, detailing the event and setting a time frame.
2. Engage Followers: Followers are invited to bid on the event, with the highest bidder earning a private meeting with the host.
3. Dynamic Bidding: Each new bid refunds the previous highest bidder, ensuring funds are not unnecessarily locked up and encouraging active participation.
4. Finalize the Meeting: Once the auction concludes, the winner is directly messaged by the host to schedule their one-on-one session.

Impact:
MeetFrames empowers users to explore their market value and opens new avenues for interaction within the Farcaster community. By removing the guesswork from pricing one's time and facilitating direct engagement, MeetFrames transforms the way users connect, learn, and grow together.

With MeetFrames, we're not just facilitating transactions; we're fostering a community where knowledge, experience, and time are valued commodities. Join us in redefining mentorship and interaction in the digital age.

How it is made:
MeetFrames is crafted with Next.js and Frames.js for the core development of event frames. This combination enabled the creation of a seamless, step-by-step process for users to auction their time, underpinned by a state management system tailored for dynamic interaction within the Farcaster ecosystem. There is also a multi-steps state-management logic process for new event creation which is fully managed on-the-fly without any backend data synchronization. 

At the heart of MeetFrames' functionality is a smart contract deployed on the Base Sepolia chain, a strategic choice that ensures integrity and transparency (and speed!:)) This contract is made for recording essential event data on-chain, allowing participants to verify the authenticity of each auction and protect against potential fraud and scam. 

To fine-tune the auction experience, MeetFrames utilizes Pinata Analytics, harnessing real-time data to adapt the minimum bid in response to event popularity. This dynamic pricing mechanism not only enhances the appeal of auctions for creators but also ensures that bids reflect the current interest levels among the community. 
At the same time, Pinata API is used to fetch actual bidder Farcaster data in a convenient way and display it to the frame owner w/o any additional storage use.
